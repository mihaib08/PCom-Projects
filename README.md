# Communication Protocols Projects [2020-2021]

The projects developed for the *Communication Protocols* class, gradually covering some of the *layers* in the **ISO/OSI** model:

01. *Router* simulator - **data link** layer
02. *Client-Server* App - **transport** layer
03. *REST API* Communication - **application** layer

This repository also contains a simple chat application (*Test-Chat*), which also covers the concepts of the **transport** layer.
